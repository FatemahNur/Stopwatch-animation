## Features
Start: Begins the stopwatch.
Pause: Pauses the stopwatch without resetting the time.
Reset: Stops the stopwatch and resets the time to 00:00:00.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure for the stopwatch interface.
CSS: Styles the stopwatch, giving it a clean and modern look.
JavaScript: Implements the functionality for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch.
